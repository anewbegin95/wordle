Wordle!

What is wordle? It's a game where you have six chances
to guess a five letter word. If you fail to guess the 
word after your sixth guess, the game ends.

The UI for the game is a 5 L x 6 H grid. You type
your five letter word guess and the letters in 
the word populate on the UI. After you enter your guess,
the UI updates by coloring the five tiles. Green tiles
mean that the word contains that letter and that
the letter is in the correct position in the word.
A yellow tile means that the word contains that letter
but that the letter is in the wrong position. Lastly,
a grey tile means that the letter is not in the word.

If a player guesses all five letters in their correct
position, all five tiles in that row turn green and 
the game ends.
